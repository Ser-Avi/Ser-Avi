- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ser-Avi
- 👀 I’m interested in the intersection of Computer Science and the Arts and Humanities.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Computer Graphics and Game Technology at the University of Pennsylvania.

- My class-related projects and thus it is mostly my older projects that show up here.
- Please reach out to me for the code for my more recent ones.
