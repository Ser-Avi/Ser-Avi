- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Ser-Avi
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the intersection of Computer Science and the Arts and Humanities.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying Computer Graphics and Game Technology at the University of Pennsylvania.

- My class and work projects are private, so it is mostly my older repos that show up.
- Please reach out to me for the code for my more recent ones.
